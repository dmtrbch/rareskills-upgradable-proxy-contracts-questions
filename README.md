# Rareskills Ppgradable Proxy Contracts Questions

1. The OZ upgrade tool for hardhat defends against 6 kinds of mistakes. What are they and why do they matter?

2. What is a beacon proxy used for?

3. Why does the openzeppelin upgradeable tool insert something like ```uint256[50] private __gap;``` inside the contracts? To see it, create an upgradeable smart contract that has a parent contract and look in the parent.

4. What is the difference between initializing the proxy and initializing the implementation? Do you need to do both? When do they need to be done?

5. What is the use for the ```reinitializer```? Provide a minimal example of proper use in Solidity
